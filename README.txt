This is a patch to improve performance when using JSRS.
This mod will conflict with any other mod that changes weapon_sounds.ltx

How to install:

1) This patch requires JSRS. The patch does not provide sound files, so YOU NEED JSRS. I recommend using a mod manager such as Mod Organizer.
   Read the mod description for instructions on how to install JSRS.
 - JSRS Sound: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/solarint-gunshot-overhaul
   - The JSRS download has multiple folders. Make sure you install the Main JSRS mod and the "Cracks + Impacts" mod that is included. 

2) Install this `JSRS Lite Patch` mod. Again, I recommend using a mod manager such as Mod Organizer. If you are updating from a previous version of JSRS Lite Patch, then delete the old version and install the new version.
 - If you want to install manually, just drag the gamedata folder into your Anomaly folder. Let it overwrite if it asks.
 
Mod Description:

My JSRS Lite Patch raises performance by reducing the number of sound layers played during gunfire. This reduces CPU load which raises performance.

In the original JSRS, each gunshot triggers multiple sound layers per shot to create the wonderful and complex sounds that you hear. This also applies to NPC gunshots.
Large-scale firefights in populated maps with many NPCs all firing at once means that the CPU load increases drastically as it tries to process all of the sound layers.

Most people's PCs can handle these scenarios without extreme performance loss, but for some people who don't have great CPUs or who want to maximize performance, this patch will come in handy.
The patch is a simple edit to reduce the overall number of sound layers per gunshot. This will allow you to play in densely populated maps with lots of AI combat without losing too much performance or needing to remove JSRS.
Please note that reduced sound layers means the sound quality will be slightly worse than JSRS's sound quality. That is a tradeoff you must be willing to make to improve performance.

Thanks to Solarint for his work on JSRS.
